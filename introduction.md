## Introduction
This app will serve a number of purposes:

* Academic: repeat old offerings and create new ones
* Finance: input fee information, compare courses, reference funding information
* Marketing: retrieve core information about course, along with marketing-specific text and details
* CIS: export single combined document containing all data, optimised for import into ProSolution with minimal effort
* Registers: allow timetables and sessions to be scheduled in advance as far as possible
* Premises: highlight courses that will run on Saturdays (i.e. when the college will need to be opened outside of usual hours)
* Forecasting: project income based on min/max student numbers, LARS funding, planned fees, and (where repeat) actual number of enrolments in previous academic year
